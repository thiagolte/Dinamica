The Options Frameworks was created to help developers build options into their themes.  This one was built as an example using a child theme of TwentyTen.  To view a video demo of how it works and read the documentation, please visit: http://wptheming.com/options-framework.

Version 0.1 of this theme was coded using WooThemes Canvas as a base (http://www.woothemes.com/2010/02/canvas/).  The Options Framework is actually a slimmed down version of their version in Canvas, and I'd encourage you to check out and support WooThemes if you find this project helpful.

If you want to set up the theme options for your own theme, drag the functions folder from the options-framework into your own theme.  Then copy the text inside functions.php and paste that into the functions.php file of your own theme (or just drag it in if you don't have a functions.php file yet in your theme.  That's it, basically.

If you want to use additional stylesheets or layouts, copy those folders into your theme as well.  If you don't, make sure the functions and options associated with them are removed from the theme functions.
